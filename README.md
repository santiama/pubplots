Pubplots quickly make nice publication quility plots from data stored in csv files.
=====================================================================================

Intended use
------------
Matplotlib is really great, but the standard format of plots are not very visually attractive. 
This liberary offers a set of scripts to be used alongside matplotlib, allowing visually
attractive plots to be quickly produced from csv files. It is not a wrapper replacing matplotlib and thus 
all matplotlib functionality is retained.

It also includes a class for holding the plot data. This class has methods for loading data from csv files,
or preparing pandas DataFrames for plotting. 

- [Examples](https://bulfinb.github.io/pubplots/pubplots#examples) are given in the documentation
